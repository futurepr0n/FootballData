# FootballData - CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the FootballData centralized storage component.

## Component Overview

The **FootballData** directory serves as the centralized data storage for the NFL analytics platform, following the same architecture as BaseballData but adapted for football-specific data structures and weekly scheduling.

## ðŸ”„ CENTRALIZED DATA ARCHITECTURE (NFL VERSION)

**CRITICAL:** FootballData serves as the single source of truth for all NFL data across the multi-sport platform:

- **Single Data Location**: `FootballData/data/` eliminates duplication between FootballTracker, FootballAPI, and FootballScraper
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes appear immediately across all NFL components
- **Weekly Structure**: Organized by season/week instead of daily format
- **Consistent Integration**: All NFL components read from same centralized source

## Directory Structure

## Data Formats and Structure

### Weekly vs Daily Organization
Unlike baseball's daily structure, NFL data is organized by season and week:

**File Naming Convention:**
- `week_01_2025.json` - Week 1 of 2025 season
- `wildcard_2025.json` - Wild card playoff week
- `superbowl_2025.json` - Super Bowl week

**Date Range Handling:**
- Regular Season: Weeks 1-18
- Playoffs: Weeks 19-22 (wildcard, divisional, conference, superbowl)
- Season typically runs September through February

## Integration Points

### FootballScraper Integration
- **CSV Output**: All scraped data outputs to `FootballData/CSV_BACKUPS/`
- **Processing**: Raw CSV files processed into JSON format in `data/stats/`
- **Schedule Files**: Weekly schedule files stored in `SCANNED/`
- **Game Data**: Individual game statistics extracted and centralized

### FootballTracker Integration
- **Data Source**: Reads all data from `../FootballData/data/`
- **Proxy Configuration**: Development proxy serves `/data/` from centralized location
- **Production Build**: Symlink `build/data` â†’ `../../FootballData/data`
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes appear immediately without rebuilds

### FootballAPI Integration
- **Analysis Engine**: Reads player and defensive stats for six-component scoring
- **Predictions**: Outputs TD predictions and fantasy projections to centralized location
- **Confidence Scoring**: Uses data completeness from centralized storage
- **Fallback System**: League averages stored centrally for missing data scenarios

## Data Processing Pipeline

### Weekly Data Collection
```bash
# 1. FootballScraper collects weekly game data
cd FootballScraper
python enhanced_nfl_scrape.py --week 1 --season 2025
# Outputs: CSV files to ../FootballData/CSV_BACKUPS/

# 2. Process and convert to JSON format
node src/services/processNFLStats.js --week 1 --season 2025
# Outputs: JSON files to ../FootballData/data/stats/

# 3. Generate predictions and analysis
cd ../FootballAPI
python enhanced_main.py
# Reads: ../FootballData/data/stats/
# Outputs: ../FootballData/data/predictions/

# 4. Update frontend with fresh data
cd ../FootballTracker
npm start
# Serves: ../FootballData/data/ via proxy
```

### Data Quality and Validation
- **Completeness Checking**: Validate required fields for confidence scoring
- **Schema Validation**: Ensure all JSON files match expected structure
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Verify player-team assignments and statistics
- **Historical Consistency**: Check for major statistical anomalies

## NFL-Specific Considerations

### Positional Categories
- **Skill Positions**: QB, RB, WR, TE (primary fantasy relevance)
- **Offensive Line**: LT, LG, C, RG, RT (blocking analysis)
- **Defense**: DE, DT, LB, CB, S (defensive matchup analysis)
- **Special Teams**: K, P, LS (kicking game analysis)

### Scoring Systems
- **Touchdown Scoring**: Six-component system adapted for NFL
- **Fantasy Projections**: Standard, PPR, and Half-PPR formats
- **Confidence Levels**: Data quality assessment for reliability
- **Matchup Analysis**: Position-specific defensive matchup evaluation

### Schedule Considerations
- **Bye Weeks**: Players not available during team bye weeks
- **Thursday/Monday Games**: Short rest impact on performance
- **International Games**: Travel and time zone considerations
- **Weather Impact**: Outdoor vs dome games, temperature, wind, precipitation

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- **Player Statistics**: Cache for 24 hours during season
- **Team Statistics**: Cache for 1 week (updated after each game week)
- **Predictions**: Generate fresh for each analysis request
- **Historical Data**: Long-term cache for season-over-season comparisons

### Data Loading Patterns
- **Lazy Loading**: Load only required week/season data
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple weeks efficiently
- **Parallel Processing**: Handle multiple position groups simultaneously
- **Memory Management**: Clear outdated data automatically

## Error Handling and Fallbacks

### Missing Data Scenarios
- **Player Injuries**: Use injury status to adjust expectations
- **Limited Sample Size**: Fall back to position averages
- **New Players**: Use college statistics or rookie projections
- **Team Changes**: Handle trades and roster moves

### Data Quality Issues
- **Incomplete Statistics**: Flag low-confidence predictions
- **Conflicting Sources**: Prioritize official NFL data
- **Delayed Updates**: Show last updated timestamps
- **Validation Failures**: Log errors and use fallback data

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Advanced Metrics**: EPA, DVOA, PFF grades integration
- **Injury Impact Analysis**: Quantify injury status on performance
- **Weather Integration**: Real-time weather data for outdoor games
- **Betting Line Integration**: Odds movement and value analysis

### Scalability Considerations
- **Multi-Season Support**: Historical data across multiple seasons
- **Real-time Updates**: Live game data integration
- **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning model integration
- **API Rate Limiting**: Manage external data source limitations

## Dependencies

### Data Sources
- **ESPN NFL**: Game statistics and box scores
- **NFL Official Data**: Roster and injury information
- **Weather Services**: Outdoor game conditions
- **Betting Odds**: Line movement and public betting data

### System Requirements
- **Storage**: Approximately 500MB per season
- **Processing**: Node.js for JSON processing, Python for analysis
- **Memory**: 2GB recommended for full season analysis
- **Network**: Reliable internet for data scraping and updates

This centralized architecture ensures consistent, real-time data access across all NFL analytics components while maintaining the same reliability and performance as the proven baseball system.
